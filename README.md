# Heart-disease_ML
This ML model predicts the probability of a new patient of having heart disease or not. Logistic Regression is used for prediction with an accuracy of 88%

# Heart Disease Classification using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease
using clinical patient data.

## Objective
To build and evaluate classification models that can identify patients at risk of heart
disease, with particular emphasis on recall due to the medical context.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Random Forest

## Evaluation Metrics
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC–AUC

## Results
The final Logistic Regression model achieved:
- Recall (disease): 0.91
- F1-score: 0.89
- Accuracy: 0.89

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
